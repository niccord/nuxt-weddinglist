# nuxt_wedding list

A website a friend of mine and I have made for his wedding, allowing its relatives to send him money via Stripe (credit card) or bank transfer.

The donation part is protected by a password which was printed on the invites.

This project is made with Nuxt.js, Express, Postgresql, Axios, Stripe, and many other awesome tecnologies.

## First thing first

Create a .env file copying .env.sample

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Fun facts

During the translation from italian to english, I've probably made some mistakes or left some untranslated message or variable:
of course, feel free to open a pull request to fix them.

I've also tried to be as gender neutral as possible (since english is not my main language)

Why? Because words are important.

Here is Nanni Moretti screaming this concept: https://youtu.be/qtP3FWRo6Ow

In the code you can find my stripe test keys.

No problems with that.

If Sarah Drasner can do that, I can too ðŸ¤£
